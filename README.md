- After filling in the data, run the setup key command:

If you are using yarn:

```bash
yarn setup-key
```

This command will set up the necessary secrets for your Cloudflare Workers application and await until the setup is complete.

4. Changing Keys:

If you need to change any key, you can use the following command:

```bash
wrangler secret delete <KEY>
```

Replace `<KEY>` with the name of the secret key you want to change. After deleting the key, you can run the setup key command again to set the new key.

5. Deploying the App:

To deploy the application, simply run:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This command will deploy your Cloudflare Workers application and make it accessible.

## Testing Telegram Bot

1. Install Bot on your group
2. Edit Bot in [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) dashboard (On Telegram) - Add slash commands `/start`
3. Copy your Worker URL on Github and add `/registerWebhook` as suffix, ex: `https://WORKER_URL/registerWebhook` - it should return `Ok` if everything works then you can move to the next step
4. Use the private chat as an admin to trigger the `/start` command and link a Github Repo to any of the listed channels
